    <h3>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</li>
        <li>I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</li>
        <li>Why would I want to know that?</li>

        <p>You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Then we'll go with that data file! I wish! It's a nickel. Really?! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
        <p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Why would a robot need to drink?</p>
        <p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Hey, tell me something. Why would I want to know that? Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</p>
        <p>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, She also liked to shut up!
        </p>
        <p>Really?! Bender, we're trying our best. Why would a robot need to drink? No! Don't jump!</p>
        <p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
