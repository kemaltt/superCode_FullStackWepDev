            <p>
                One of my absolute favourite parts of Christmas are the sweets. There are so many amazing deserts you can make! Here is a list of some
                <b>delicious</b> homemade holiday treats that I would recommend:

        This week I decided to make different cookies such as gingerbread!
        Here's a look at how they turned out:

      <p>
        This Christmas I wanted to try and create my own decorations instead
        of buying them from stores. I made a variety of decorations from
        scratch, such as a candy cane wreath and Santa Clause cutlery
        holders.<br />

        Christmas would not be the same without a christmas tree. After having
        decorated my tree I have come up with steps so that you get your tree
        looking as <strong>amazing</strong> as possible.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Set up your tree on the stand and add the skirt. Then separate the
          branches as best as possible
        </li>
        <li>Add on the lights starting from the top.</li>
        <li>
          Put your ornaments on branches, trying to spread them equally around
          the tree
        </li>
        <li>Last but not least, add the tinsel</li>
      </ol>
