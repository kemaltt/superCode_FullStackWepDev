        <h1>I have a dark side, too.</h1>
        <p>I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. God created pudding, and then he rested. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.</p>
        <p>I'm partial to air conditioning. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. <strong> With my own set of rules.</strong>            <em> I'm Dexter.</em> Boo.</p>
        <h2>I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.</h2>

        <h1>Across from where?</h1>
        <p>Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Whoa, this guy's straight? I care deeply for nature. Steve Holt! It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.</p>
        <p>I hear the jury's still out on science. <strong> Steve Holt!</strong> <em> Guy's a pro.</em> He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.</p>
        <h2>We just call it a sausage.</h2>
